in this video we'll be visualizing how arrays are stored and accessed
and explain how you should be approaching functions that deal with arrays

by the end of this series of array videos, you should be able to visualize and write the solutions to barkeshli's assignments
as well as be able to problem solve your way through the majority of leetcode *vine boom with faang logo * easy to medium array problems

====
*talk about memory and contiguous-ness in article portion*
ok, we've dangled the carrot *faang ka-ching money noise*
now let's start walking the pig.

let's quickly summarize initializing and accessing values of an array

========
NEW MANIM SECTION: showing array with values and their indices
========

if i were to initialize an int array named arr that holds values 1-7, using the following statement
int arr[10] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}; <- ****MANIM TEXT****

the array would look something like this:
*manim animation of numbers being put in boxes*

the values of our int array are now stored, 
but in order to actually do anything useful with our array, we need to be able to access said values,

========
NEW MANIM SECTION: indexing (HIGHLIGHTING THE VALUE BOX)
========

for accessing values, we will need the indexes of our elements. 
*on screen explanation- element is more accurate term for the entities stored at each index, with value being the data stored in the element itself; example of this in action: the element stored at index 0 has a value of 1*
*manim animation of 0-10 index being put below the array boxes* *on screen: indexes in c++ always start at 0*

so, if we want value 6, we would call the array's name followed by brackets with the index inside
**NEW MANIM TEXT: arr[5];
*manim of 6's box and index being highlighted*

great, now you know how to visualize an array and how access any value at a given index.
we have one last core concept to go over before we transition into writing some basic array functions: array traversal

========
NEW MANIM SECTION: FOR LOOP ANIMATION (TEXT BREAKDOWN + PRINT FOR LOOP)
========

almost every array operation you'll be writing requires some form of traversal, where you are basically examining or manipulating each element in an array to get a result;
printing would be outputting each element in an array with a cout statement, searching would be examining each element and evaluating it, etc. etc

in practice, array traversal is just a loop with bounds you choose; 
for traversing through our int array,
we would start at the first index and go through each element till we reach the last index
*manim highlight 1st box and last box*

this can be written as for int i equals zero, when i is less than size, i plus plus
for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){}; ****NEW MANIM TEXT****
remember, our starting index is 0 and we want to increment by 1 until we reach our last index.
*have manim box arround each clause accordingly*

to see this for loop in action, let's look at a standard array print function: ****NEW MANIM TEXT******
we can break it down as a loop that goes through each index, prints it, and moves to the next index 
*manim highlighting each clause* *below it the arrow will start pointing!!!* fk

for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
    cout << a[i] << endl;
}


as a short review of this section:
you should be able to visualize an array's elements and indices and how to fully traverse one.

==================

ok, we have our fundamentals down. we're ready to start approaching some basic array functions.

before writing any code, we need to be looking at the function signature for clues on what we'll be writing

let's look at this search function.
we're given a return type of int and the parameters of an int array, its size, and an int val
and its name is search;

given these parameters and its name, we can assume that we'll be searching the array given to us, *highlighting arrary*
searching for what--search for a value that equals the int val we're given  *highlighting int val*
and we're returning an int, that means we're likely returning the index of the value in the array

by looking at the function signature, we've just given ourselves the 3 steps we need:

1. a loop through our given array || a[0] - a[size]
2. an evaluation that occurs within the loop || if(a[i] == val)
3. and what we should return if our evaluation is succesful || return i

great, now that we know what we need to do, let's start writing the logic of our code;
we know that we'll need a loop that runs 0 thru size amount of times
*manim animation of int array* 

//EDGE CASE DISCUSSION.
ok our code is basically almost perfect, we still need to consider one last thing: edge cases;
what if our array doesn't contain an element with the value: val; then nothing would be returned and we break our return type contract of int
let's write a return statement that mitigates this and will be useful later on when used: 
return -1;

ok, let's review what we did; we wrote a loop that traversed (went through) the array
and then we evaluated if the array's value was == to the given int val
we return index i
